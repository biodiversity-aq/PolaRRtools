# PolaRRtools

<< work in progress>>

PolaRRtools is an R package develloped by the POLA3R-team to ease the re-use of molecular microbial datasets. 

## Introduction
Ecological research of microbes increasingly relies high throughput DNA sequencing techniques to answer questions on biodiversity, functional composition and biogeography. The ‘omics datasets that are generated in this process are highly rich sources of information that stay relevant to the scientific community for years, perhaps even centuries, after the the results have been published.

However, it can be a remarkably complex venture to find and download the sequence data from interesting projects. With the PolaRRtools package, we aim to make these data much more accessible. PolaRRtools provides tools to download nucleotide sequence data from the INSDC databases directly through the R-console. Moreover, data can be downloaded in bulk, and the functions can be piped to existing data processing pipelines, significanty reducting the time investment cost of data re-use.

## Background
PolaRRtools R-package is part of the LifeWatch (Belgium) Virtual Research Environment (VRE), and was made to closely integrate with the Polar’Omics Links in Arctic-Antarctic-Alpine (3 A's) Research portal, or POLA3R for short.

In addition, PolaRRtools was made to closely link to the Polar’Omics Links in Arctic-Antarctic-Alpine (3 A's) Research portal, or POLA3R for short. This is a thematic online portal that focusses molecular biodiversity data resources from polar regions, and is also part of the LifeWatch VRE. On POLA3R molecular (public) datasets are enriched with the associated metadata and environmental information (often dislocated from the data in publication tables or apendices of a publication). On the POLA3R poral, we store the metadata and environmetal data, and link this to the associated publications and the sequences on INSDC. To allow interoperability with other systems, the portal is also designed to operate between different data archiving standards, such as the Minimum Information on any (x) Sequence (MIxS) as well as DarwinCore. Datasets that are listed on POLA3R are also registered on GBIF to increase their discoverability. As such, POLA3R aims to provide a hub for the polar scientific community, where they can discover high quality and complete molecular biodiversity data.




After publication, molecular datasets

with different interconnected types of information that are mutually indispensable, including sequencing data, geographical and environmental context data as well as laboratory protocol metadata. This complexity poses serious challenges for data archiving and discoverability on open access repositories. More specifically, the architecture of commonly used biodiversity databases (e.g. Global Biodiversity Information Facility; GBIF) is typically centered around occurrences of organisms, and not metagenomic sequences, while the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) prioritizes the nucleotide data, with environmental variables or metadata difficult to find or query and often incomplete.
