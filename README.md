# PolaRRtools

<< work in progress>>

PolaRRtools is an R package develloped by the POLA3R-team to ease the re-use of molecular microbial datasets. 

## Introduction
The POLA3R portal 

However, it can be a remarkably complex venture to find and download the sequence data from interesting projects. With the PolaRRtools package, we aim to make these data much more accessible. PolaRRtools provides tools to download nucleotide sequence data from the INSDC databases directly through the R-console. Moreover, data can be downloaded in bulk, and the functions can be piped to existing data processing pipelines, significanty reducting the time investment cost of data re-use.
